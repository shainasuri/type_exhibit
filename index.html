            <div class="index-description">
                Design is a very powerful tool that can be used to represent, change, and impact the world in many ways. As a growing designer, my aim is to create work that accomplishes the task of bridging various creative fields together that reflect certain ideas and themes that should have a place in our visual culture. These fields include film, music, art, and photography, which I aim to amalgamate with typography and graphic design, in my own way, using the skills I am learning along the way. 
                <br><br>
                These skills and awareness of typographic practices that I use as tools to design, largely come from the many resources that have been shared as a part of this curriculum. This includes readings related to issues, articles, and debates related to typography and communication design. As a designer I tend to respond to these by reverberating the messages and ideas that resonated most with myself. Therefore, through this series of short typographic responses, I have tried to represent the aforementioned messages and snippets from the readings, by presenting them in real design contexts. My choice to do this stems from the idea of my ‘why’, as I try to integrate creative fields with typography, thus, through these reading responses, I am exhibiting these points among different creative mediums of expression and communication. 
                <br><br>
                This series is an exhibition of typographic experimentation and exploration, from my perspective. It is a reflection of the insight I have gained as a result of these readings, enabling me to understand and appreciate the history and nuances of typography and communication design.
